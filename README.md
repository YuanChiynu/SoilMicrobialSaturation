### Abstract
Community saturation levels (ratio of observed microbial abundance to environmental carrying capacity) are a critical regulator of microbial community stability. Using a sterilized soil dilution approach across four saturation gradients (10%, 40%, 70%, 100%) in cropland, forest, and grassland ecosystems, we demonstrate that higher saturation levels significantly enhance resistance stability of microbial diversity, community structure, and functional profiles under temperature/moisture/pH/organic carbon/nitrogen manipulations. Community saturation also reshaped co-occurrence networks, increasing robustness while reducing complexity (e.g., 10%-saturation networks had >2Ã— links vs. 100%-saturation). These findings establish community saturation as a key predictor of microbiome stability.
